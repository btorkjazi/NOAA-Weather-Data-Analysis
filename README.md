# NOAA-Weather-Data-Analysis
In this project I used files of historical weather data from NOAA for different weather stations in the US and all around the world and tried to parse each data file and unroll it so I can have the files in a pleasant format which I need for more analysis. I handled missed data points with NumPy functions and analyzed the data to find total annual precipitation and annual mean precipitation for each station. I also found the stations with the most/least precipitation in the past five years, and the stations with strictly increasing/decreasing means in the past 20 years. For the final part of this project I calculated the total annual precipitation for each country for the past 5 years and plotted the precipitation for top 10 and bottom 10 countries. I also found the precipitation for each continent and plotted the precipitation for each continent as well.
